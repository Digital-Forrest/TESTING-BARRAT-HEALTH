                At Barrat Behavioral Health, we understand that anxiety can be overwhelming, interfering with school, work, relationships, and daily life. Anxiety is not simply "worrying too much"—it is a mental health condition that deserves compassion, understanding, and professional care.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our goal is to provide supportive, evidence-based treatment for children, teens, and adults living with anxiety disorders—helping each individual regain balance, confidence, and peace of mind.

              <h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold">Understanding Anxiety</h2>
              <p>Anxiety disorders can take many forms, including:</p>
              <ul className="space-y-2">
                {anxietyTypes.map((type, index) => (
                  <li key={index} className="flex items-start gap-3">
                    <span className="text-brand-orange mt-1">•</span>
                    <span>{type}</span>
                  </li>
                ))}
              </ul>
              <p>
                In addition to emotional distress, anxiety may cause restlessness, irritability, difficulty sleeping, racing thoughts, rapid heartbeat, or shortness of breath.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold">Our Approach</h2>
              <p>
                At Barrat Behavioral Health, we use a patient-centered, holistic approach that considers the whole person—not just symptoms.
              </p>
              <p>Your care may include:</p>
              <ul className="space-y-4">
                {approaches.map((approach, index) => (
                  <li key={index} className="flex items-start gap-4">
                    <CheckCircle className="h-6 w-6 text-brand-orange flex-shrink-0 mt-1" />
                    <span>{approach}</span>
                  </li>
                ))}
              </ul>
              <p>
                Our focus is not only on reducing symptoms but also on building long-term resilience, coping skills, and confidence.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold">A Path to Peace</h2>
              <p>
                Living with anxiety doesn't have to mean living with constant fear. With the right support, it is possible to restore balance, reclaim confidence, and move forward with clarity and peace of mind.
              </p>
              <p>
