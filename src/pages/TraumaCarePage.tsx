Whether from loss, abuse, violence, or other overwhelming events, trauma can leave deep emotional and physical impacts.

              <p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold">Understanding Trauma</h2>
              <p>
                Trauma is the mind and body's natural response to overwhelming stress. While each person's experience is unique, trauma can leave lasting effects that interfere with daily life, relationships, and overall well-being.
              </p>
              <p>Common effects of trauma may include:</p>
              <ul className="space-y-2">
                {effects.map((effect, index) => (
                  <li key={index} className="flex items-start gap-3">
                    <span className="text-brand-orange mt-1">•</span>
                    <span>{effect}</span>
                  </li>
                ))}
              </ul>
              <p>
                These responses are not signs of weakness—they are your mind and body's way of coping with overwhelming experiences.
