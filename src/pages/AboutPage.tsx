              <p>Partnering with us means embracing a journey where clinical expertise meets heartfelt support. With compassion at the center of everything we do, we’ll walk alongside you through each step of your healing process—offering guidance, encouragement, and tools that promote sustainable wellness and meaningful, positive change.</p>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl">What to expect In your first session with me:</h3>
              <p>In your first session with me, you can expect a warm, welcoming environment where we focus on building a strong foundation of trust. We'll take time to explore your medical and mental health history, discuss what’s bringing you in, and begin identifying meaningful goals for your care. This session is a two-way conversation—while I’ll guide us with thoughtful questions, you are encouraged to share at your own pace and in your own words.</p>
              <p>My therapeutic approach is personalized and grounded in evidence-based practices. I integrate Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to help reframe unhelpful thought patterns, Motivational Interviewing to encourage positive behavior change, and Trauma-Informed Care to ensure safety and empowerment throughout the healing process. Depending on your needs, I may also incorporate mindfulness strategies, solution-focused techniques, and supportive counseling to guide you toward lasting wellness.</p>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl">Between sessions:</h3>
              <p>My commitment to your care doesn’t end when our appointment does. While I cannot provide ongoing therapy or full consultations outside of scheduled sessions, I remain available for important updates, urgent concerns, or questions about your treatment plan.</p>
              <p>For non-urgent matters, you can contact me through the patient portal, by email, or by leaving a voicemail. I aim to respond within 1–2 business days.</p>
              <p>For urgent issues that cannot wait until our next appointment, I may offer a brief check-in or arrange an earlier session, depending on the situation.</p>
              <p>For emergencies, please call 911, go to the nearest emergency department, or call/text the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988.</p>
              <p>This balance helps maintain clear boundaries while ensuring you have the support and guidance you need between visits.</p>
