                At Barrat Behavioral Health, we understand how deeply Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) can affect daily life. PTSD may develop after experiencing or witnessing distressing events such as violence, abuse, accidents, or sudden loss. While these experiences may be in the past, their impact can remain—making it difficult to feel safe, connected, or in control.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our mission is to provide compassionate, trauma-informed care that supports healing, recovery, and renewed resilience.

              <p>
                PTSD is more than just a reaction to trauma—it is a condition where the mind and body remain on high alert long after the event has passed. Symptoms can look different for each person, but may include:
              </p>
              <ul className="space-y-2">
                {symptoms.map((symptom, index) => (
                  <li key={index} className="flex items-start gap-3">
                    <span className="text-brand-orange mt-1">•</span>
                    <span>{symptom}</span>
                  </li>
                ))}
              </ul>
              <p>
                These responses are not personal failings—they are the body's way of trying to protect itself from further harm.
