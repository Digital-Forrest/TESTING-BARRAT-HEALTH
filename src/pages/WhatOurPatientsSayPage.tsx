Her holistic, biopsychosocial approach and collaborative style make a real difference, especially when managing complex health needs. She is highly accessible, responsive between sessions, and always open to adjusting treatment based on what is or isn't working. Kadija takes the time to build realistic, step-by-step plans that can adjust as your needs and circumstances change, and she is not afraid to advocate on your behalf when insurance or other providers become difficult. Scheduling is simple, and I highly recommend her to anyone seeking thoughtful, thorough, and effective care."

The pain I carried had twisted me into someone I didn't even like—someone I barely recognized. I had already done damage I couldn't undo. People walked away. Trust was broken. And for a while, I thought I deserved to stay stuck in that place.\n\nBut Kadija didn't treat me like I was beyond repair. She helped me confront the pain instead of avoiding it. She listened without judgment, challenged me to take accountability, and reminded me, week after week, that healing is messy but possible. Her guidance gave me the tools to rebuild. I still struggle with shame. I still wrestle with the past. But the difference now is that I don't let those feelings define me. I've grown more than I ever thought I could, and I have the courage to keep moving forward, even when I'm hurting.\n\nThanks to her, I'm no longer just surviving. I'm learning how to live. And that's the kind of revenge no pain or regret can take from me. If you're lost, if you're ashamed, if you're convinced you're too far gone, please go to Kadija. It can change everything."

After various mediocre experiences with other clinicians throughout the years, finding someone who cares, checks in, and goes above and beyond is nearly unheard of nowadays. I can truly say Kadija is far and away the best provider I've had the privilege of being a patient of. Her approach is exactly what you hope to find in a clinician—medication management + smart solution-focused conversation. She truly listens and urges you to ask her questions, discuss any concerns, all while being very receptive to make appropriate adjustments. She is great about explaining the 'why' and what is going on in the brain. I could go on and on with how wonderful she is. She has great energy and makes it easy to open up. Current patient for almost a year here."

I really appreciate that she trusts her patients in their understanding of their own health and well-being and wants to help you meet your wellness goals. I have spent years changing around providers and finally feel progress and control. She is very communicative and always available for scheduling when needed.

While my previous therapists were kind and helpful, our work remained limited to talk therapy. Dr. K, on the other hand, brought a depth of knowledge, patience, and relatability that made all the difference. She gently helped me overcome my fear of medication and guided me through a process of healing I never thought possible.\n\nAfter six months of working with her—through medication management and supportive therapy—I began to feel like myself again. For the first time in years, I wasn't just surviving; I was living. I found myself breathing easier and finding joy in the small things, something I hadn't experienced in a long time due to ongoing trauma.\n\nWithout family nearby, I often felt alone—but with Dr. K, I felt like I finally had a support system. She is incredibly compassionate and thoughtful, and I can't put into words how grateful I am for the care she's given me. She has played such a pivotal role in my healing, and I truly can't thank her enough."
