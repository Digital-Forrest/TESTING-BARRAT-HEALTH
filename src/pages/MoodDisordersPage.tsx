                At Barrat Behavioral Health, we understand that mood plays a powerful role in shaping how we think, feel, and function. When mood becomes difficult to regulate, it can affect relationships, work, school, and overall quality of life.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our mission is to provide compassionate, professional care for individuals living with mood disorders—helping them find stability, strength, and hope.

              <h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold">Understanding Mood Disorders</h2>
              <p>
                Mood disorders are conditions that affect a person's emotional state over extended periods of time. While everyone experiences ups and downs, mood disorders involve changes that are more intense, longer lasting, and often disruptive to daily life.
              </p>
              <p>These may include:</p>
              <ul className="space-y-2">
                {symptoms.map((symptom, index) => (
                  <li key={index} className="flex items-start gap-3">
                    <span className="text-brand-orange mt-1">•</span>
                    <span>{symptom}</span>
                  </li>
                ))}
              </ul>
              <p>
                Living with these patterns can feel overwhelming—but with the right support, healing and balance are possible.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold">Our Approach</h2>
              <p>
                At Barrat Behavioral Health, we take a holistic, trauma-informed, and patient-centered approach to supporting individuals with mood disorders.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your care begins with a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation, where we take the time to understand your experiences and how your mood has impacted your life. From there, we design a tailored plan that may include:
              </p>
              <ul className="space-y-4">
                {approaches.map((approach, index) => (
                  <li key={index} className="flex items-start gap-4">
                    <CheckCircle className="h-6 w-6 text-brand-orange flex-shrink-0 mt-1" />
                    <span>{approach}</span>
                  </li>
                ))}
              </ul>
              <p>
                Treatment is not just about symptom relief—it's about helping you feel more in control, building resilience, and restoring a sense of purpose and hope.
