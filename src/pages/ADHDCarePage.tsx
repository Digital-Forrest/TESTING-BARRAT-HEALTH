                At Barrat Behavioral Health, we understand that Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is more than just difficulty focusing. ADHD is a neurodevelopmental condition that impacts how individuals manage attention, energy, and impulses.
              </p>
              <p>
                While ADHD can bring challenges at school, work, or home, it can also come with unique strengths—such as creativity, innovation, and high energy. Our mission is to provide neurodivergent-affirming, compassionate care that helps children, teens, and adults with ADHD thrive in their everyday lives.

              <h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold">Understanding ADHD</h2>
              <p>
                ADHD looks different for everyone. Some people experience primarily inattention (difficulty focusing or staying organized), while others may experience hyperactivity and impulsivity. Many live with a combination of both.
              </p>
              <p>Common challenges may include:</p>
              <ul className="space-y-2">
                {challenges.map((challenge, index) => (
                  <li key={index} className="flex items-start gap-3">
                    <span className="text-brand-orange mt-1">•</span>
                    <span>{challenge}</span>
                  </li>
                ))}
              </ul>
              <p>
                It is important to remember: ADHD is not a lack of intelligence or ability—it is simply a different way of processing and engaging with the world.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold">Our Approach</h2>
              <p>
                At Barrat Behavioral Health, we take a holistic, patient-centered approach to ADHD care. We begin with a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation that considers medical, social, and personal factors affecting daily life.
              </p>
              <p>Based on this assessment, we design an individualized plan that may include:</p>
              <ul className="space-y-4">
                {approaches.map((approach, index) => (
                  <li key={index} className="flex items-start gap-4">
                    <CheckCircle className="h-6 w-6 text-brand-orange flex-shrink-0 mt-1" />
                    <span>{approach}</span>
                  </li>
                ))}
              </ul>
              <p>
                Our goal is to help each individual leverage their strengths while addressing challenges in a supportive and non-judgmental way.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold">Helping Every Individual</h2>
              <p>
                ADHD can feel overwhelming—but with the right support, it can also be a pathway to growth and success. At Barrat Behavioral Health, we provide the tools, encouragement, and care needed to navigate challenges while building confidence and resilience.
              </p>
              <p>
                We believe that with understanding and guidance, every individual with ADHD has the ability to flourish—because every mind deserves the chance to thrive.
