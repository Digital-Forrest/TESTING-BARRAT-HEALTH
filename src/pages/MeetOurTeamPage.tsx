                  "My journey to becoming a mental healthcare provider began with a deep passion for understanding the human experience and a commitment to caring for the whole person—mind, body, and spirit. As a nurse, I saw firsthand how mental health impacts every aspect of a person's well-being, often in ways that go unseen or untreated. That insight drove me to pursue dual board certification as a Family Nurse Practitioner and a Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner. Over the past decade, I've had the privilege of walking alongside individuals and families during some of their most vulnerable moments. Each experience has reinforced my belief in compassionate, holistic care and the power of connection, healing, and resilience. This work is not just my profession—it's my calling." - Kadija Conteh-Barrat

                  Hi there, I'm Amanda! I'm a dual board-certified Family Nurse Practitioner (FNP-C) and Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurse Practitioner (PMHNP-BC) with over five years of experience providing compassionate, evidence-based care to adults 18 and older.

                  I'm passionate about supporting individuals in achieving balance and wellness, both mentally and physically. My approach integrates medical and psychiatric care to treat the whole person, not just the symptoms. Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of caring for active-duty service members, veterans, and underserved populations, experiences that have deepened my commitment to improving access to high-quality, equitable healthcare.

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  I specialize in treating a wide range of mental health conditions, including ADHD, anxiety, depression, mood disorders, and PTSD. Using a combination of medication management and psychotherapy, I work with each patient to develop a treatment plan tailored to their unique needs, goals, and lifestyle.

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  My approach to care is welcoming, empathetic, and grounded in respect for the courage it takes to seek help, especially in a world where mental health is still too often stigmatized. I believe healing happens through collaboration. By providing education, guidance, and ongoing support, I empower my patients to take an active role in their care and make informed decisions about their health.

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  Ultimately, my goal is to promote lasting wellness and meaningful change by addressing the whole person—mind, body, and environment. I strive to create a safe, supportive space where every individual feels heard, valued, and encouraged on their journey toward healing.
